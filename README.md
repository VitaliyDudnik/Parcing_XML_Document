Parsing XML document

The task that was solved

The program receives as input a string to the folder where the document is located.
You only need to parse one document - accordingly, provide for various checks, for example, for the fact that there are no files in the folder, or there are several xml documents in the folder and other possible checks.
If the transferred folder does not contain files, but contains only one other subfolder - therefore, you need to check the contents of the subfolder.

It is necessary to parse the xml document and write the contents of the line tags to another document.
The name of the file for recording must consist of tag values and has the form: <firstName> _ <lastName> _ <title> .txt

if the value 1 is entered from the console - parse the document using SAX
if the value 2 is entered from the console - parse the document using the DOM
